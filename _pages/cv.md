Summary
======
Current Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University under the advising of Professor Juan J. Alonso. He holds a M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford and a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University. His research focuses on design space exploration, multi-physics analysis and optimization, physics-informed machine learning (AI4Science), data mining, and applied surrogate modeling. He works on the development of the SUAVE and SU2 open-source software.
